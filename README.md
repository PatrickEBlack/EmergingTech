# ELIZA Chatbot

Implementation of Eliza Chatbot using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

## Overview
This project is a recreation of the famous ELIZA chatbot, implementing pattern matching and response generation in JavaScript. This chatbot runs in the browser.

## Demo
You can find the chatbot here: (https://github.com/PatrickEBlack/EmergingTech/tree/main/eliza)

## Features
- Natural language pattern matching
- Dynamic response generation
- Modern, responsive interface
- No external dependencies
- Runs entirely in the browser

## Technical Details
- Built with vanilla JavaScript
- Uses regular expressions for pattern matching
- Implements a responsive design using CSS

## Limitations
- Set responses means there is little wiggle room for user input
- Some responses may seem like they are not accurate to the users input

## References
- Some of the JavaScript that I was not familiar with was found at: (https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_regexp_begin.asp)
- Very few of the design aspect of this chatbot were found at: (https://academy.quriobot.com/how-to-build-an-advanced-bot/css-customization-for-your-bot-design/)
- HTML is all of my design (Not that its very complex)
